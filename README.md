<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The design challenge was to design a can crusher which crushes sideways rather than downwards, to yield the highest recyclable surface area. This was a structural challenge, that was approached by adding triangular supports on the crushing way. These helped the discs on the can fold inward.

The project was completely automated with the use of two IR sesors. One sensed when a can was present to be crushed, and the other sensor checked when that can had left the system throught the slot. In case of an emergency, a stop button was present. Furthermore, to make crushing cans fun, a hoop was incorporated in the form of a cone. This was made using acrylic for aesthetics, and so that the user could see their can get oriented appopriately.
